Some scripts and tools to work with preload.

Notes:  

* The .csv files in the preload-database repository are written in UTF-8 encoding which is the preferred format in use.   
* When preload .csv files are opened in different type of file formats the characters are transcribed into non-traditional formatting, which is not acceptable.  
* The present code is written to avoid any formatting changes when committing pull requests.
