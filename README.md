Purpose:  
  To commit changes to preload-database repository from within Github.  
Notes:   
1-	The .csv files in the preload-database repository are written in UTF-8 encoding which is the preferred format in use.   
2-	When preload .csv files are opened in different type of file formats the characters are transcribed into non-traditional formatting, which is not acceptable.  
3-	The present code is written to avoid any formatting changes when committing pull requests.
